# Setup Instructions for GitHub Repository

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Set the repository name to: `intelligence-crm`
4. Add description: "A comprehensive microservices-based CRM platform built with LangChain, FastAPI, and modern cloud-native technologies"
5. Make sure it's set to **Public** (or Private if preferred)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace 'yourusername' with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/intelligence-crm.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys set up)

```bash
# Add the remote repository using SSH
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/intelligence-crm.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Repository

After pushing, you should see all your files in the GitHub repository at:
`https://github.com/yourusername/intelligence-crm`

## Repository Structure

Your repository will contain:
- Complete Analytics Service implementation
