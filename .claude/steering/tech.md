## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Decision Log

1. **Microservices over Monolith**: Chosen for independent scaling, technology diversity (Python for AI, Go for performance), and team autonomy. Trade-off: Increased operational complexity managed through Kubernetes and service mesh.

2. **LangChain + LangGraph**: Selected for rapid AI development and workflow orchestration. Provides abstraction over LLM providers and enables complex multi-agent workflows essential for intelligent automation.

3. **TypeScript Frontend**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience. Material-UI chosen for enterprise-ready components and accessibility compliance required for SMB market.

4. **Google Cloud Platform**: Provides integrated AI services (Vertex AI), managed infrastructure, and compliance certifications needed for enterprise sales. Cost optimization through committed use discounts.

5. **PostgreSQL + Firestore Hybrid**: PostgreSQL for transactional consistency, Firestore for real-time features. Avoids vendor lock-in while leveraging Google Cloud's managed services.

6. **Go for Core Services**: Chosen for performance-critical operations like authentication and real-time messaging. Lower resource usage reduces operational costs for SMB-focused pricing model.

## Known Limitations

- **AI Model Dependencies**: Reliance on external LLM providers (OpenAI, Google) creates potential latency and cost concerns. Mitigation: Implement caching and consider on-premise models for future versions.

- **Multi-tenancy Complexity**: Current design uses shared databases with tenant isolation. Future consideration: Move to database-per-tenant for larger customers requiring data residency.

- **Real-time Scaling**: WebSocket connections require sticky sessions, limiting horizontal scaling. Future solution: Implement Redis-based session sharing or move to serverless WebSocket solutions.

- **Development Environment Complexity**: Multiple services require significant local resources. Mitigation: Provide cloud-based development environments and selective service startup options.

- **AI Model Versioning**: No current strategy for AI model versioning and A/B testing. Future implementation: MLOps pipeline with model experiment tracking and gradual rollouts.
