## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Decision Log

1. **Microservices over Monolith**: Chosen for independent scaling, technology diversity (Python for AI, Go for performance), and team autonomy. Trade-off: Increased operational complexity managed through Kubernetes and service mesh.

2. **LangChain + LangGraph**: Selected for rapid AI development and workflow orchestration. Provides abstraction over LLM providers and enables complex multi-agent workflows essential for intelligent automation.

3. **TypeScript Frontend**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience. Material-UI chosen for enterprise-ready components and accessibility compliance required for SMB market.

4. **Google Cloud Platform**: Provides integrated AI services (Vertex AI), managed infrastructure, and compliance certifications needed for enterprise sales. Cost optimization through committed use discounts.

5. **PostgreSQL + Firestore Hybrid**: PostgreSQL for transactional consistency, Firestore for real-time features. Avoids vendor lock-in while leveraging Google Cloud's managed services.

6. **Go for Core Services**: Chosen for performance-critical operations like authentication and real-time messaging. Lower resource usage reduces operational costs for SMB-focused pricing model.

## Known Limitations

- **AI Model Dependencies**: Reliance on external LLM providers (OpenAI, Google) creates potential latency and cost concerns. Mitigation: Implement caching and consider on-premise models for future versions.

- **Multi-tenancy Complexity**: Current design uses shared databases with tenant isolation. Future consideration: Move to database-per-tenant for larger customers requiring data residency.

- **Real-time Scaling**: WebSocket connections require sticky sessions, limiting horizontal scaling. Future solution: Implement Redis-based session sharing or move to serverless WebSocket solutions.

- **Development Environment Complexity**: Multiple services require significant local resources. Mitigation: Provide cloud-based development environments and selective service startup options.

- **AI Model Versioning**: No current strategy for AI model versioning and A/B testing. Future implementation: MLOps pipeline with model experiment tracking and gradual rollouts.

2. External library imports (alphabetical)
3. Internal shared utilities and types
4. Relative imports from same feature
5. CSS/style imports

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useQuery, useMutation } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { Box, Typography, Button } from '@mui/material';

import { apiClient } from '@/services/api';
import { ContactData, APIResponse } from '@/types/crm';
import { formatDate, validateEmail } from '@/utils/common';

import { ContactFormProps } from './types';
import './ContactForm.css';
```

### Import Order (Python)
1. Standard library imports
2. Third-party library imports
3. Local application imports
4. Relative imports

```python
import asyncio
import json
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

from app.core.config import settings
from app.models.contact import Contact
from app.services.crm_service import CRMService

from .schemas import ContactCreate, ContactResponse
```

### Import Order (Go)
1. Standard library imports
2. Third-party imports
3. Local package imports

```go
import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "time"

    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "github.com/google/uuid"
    "gorm.io/gorm"

    "github.com/your-org/crm-management/internal/models"
    "github.com/your-org/crm-management/internal/services"
    "github.com/your-org/crm-management/pkg/logger"
)
```

## Code Structure Patterns

### Microservice Organization (Go)
```go
// internal/handlers/contact_handler.go
package handlers

// 1. Imports and dependencies
// 2. Handler struct definition
// 3. Constructor function
// 4. HTTP handler methods
// 5. Helper/validation functions
// 6. Error handling utilities
```

### Service Layer Organization (Python)
```python
# app/services/ai_orchestration_service.py

# 1. Imports and type definitions
# 2. Service class definition
# 3. Constructor and dependency injection
# 4. Public interface methods
# 5. Private helper methods
# 6. Error handling and logging
```

### React Component Organization (TypeScript)
```typescript
// src/components/crm/ContactForm.tsx

// 1. Imports (external, internal, types)
// 2. Interface/type definitions
// 3. Component definition with props
// 4. Custom hooks and state management
// 5. Event handlers and business logic
// 6. Render logic and JSX
// 7. Default export and named exports
```

## Code Organization Principles

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Each microservice represents a clear business domain with well-defined boundaries
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between API layer, business logic, and data access
3. **Dependency Injection**: Services receive dependencies through constructors for testability
4. **Single Responsibility**: Each module, class, and function has one clear purpose
5. **Interface Segregation**: Define focused interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones
6. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling patterns across all services and layers

## Module Boundaries

### Service Communication
- **Public APIs**: Well-defined REST and GraphQL APIs for external communication
- **Internal Communication**: gRPC for high-performance inter-service communication
- **Event-Driven**: Use Cloud Pub/Sub for asynchronous, decoupled communication
- **Shared Types**: Protocol buffer definitions in `/shared/proto/` for type safety

### Dependency Direction
- **Frontend → Services**: Only through public APIs, never direct database access
- **Services → Shared**: Can depend on shared utilities and types
- **Services ↔ Services**: Only through public APIs, no direct dependencies
- **Infrastructure ← Services**: Services depend on infrastructure abstractions, not implementations

### Data Access Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access behind interfaces for testability
- **Database per Service**: Each microservice owns its data and database schema
- **Event Sourcing**: Consider for audit trails and complex business workflows
- **Read Models**: Separate read and write models for optimal performance

## Code Size Guidelines

### File Size Limits
- **Go files**: Maximum 500 lines per file
- **Python files**: Maximum 400 lines per file
- **TypeScript files**: Maximum 300 lines per file (components), 500 lines (utilities)
- **Configuration files**: Keep focused and under 200 lines

### Function/Method Size
- **Functions**: Maximum 50 lines for complex business logic, 20 lines preferred
- **HTTP handlers**: Maximum 30 lines, delegate to service layer
- **React components**: Maximum 150 lines, extract custom hooks for complex logic
- **Database queries**: Use query builders or ORMs, avoid raw SQL over 10 lines

### Complexity Guidelines
- **Cyclomatic complexity**: Maximum 10 per function
- **Nesting depth**: Maximum 4 levels of nested blocks
- **Parameter count**: Maximum 5 parameters per function, use structs/objects for more
