# Implementation Plan - AI/ML Orchestration Service

## Task Overview
This implementation plan breaks down the AI/ML Orchestration Service into atomic, agent-friendly tasks that can be executed independently. The approach follows microservices patterns with FastAPI, LangChain, and LangGraph while integrating seamlessly with existing CRM Core Services infrastructure.

## Steering Document Compliance
Tasks follow structure.md conventions for Python service development with app/ directory organization, snake_case naming, and comprehensive testing. Implementation leverages existing CRM service patterns for authentication, multi-tenancy, and database connections while following tech.md standards for AI/ML stack integration.

## Atomic Task Requirements
**Each task meets optimal agent execution criteria:**
- **File Scope**: Touches 1-3 related files maximum for focused implementation
- **Time Boxing**: Completable in 15-30 minutes by experienced developer
- **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task with clear success criteria
- **Specific Files**: Exact file paths specified for creation/modification
- **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching between tasks

## Task Format Guidelines
- Use checkbox format: `- [ ] Task number. Task description`
- **Specify files**: Always include exact file paths to create/modify
- **Include implementation details** as bullet points
- Reference requirements using: `_Requirements: X.Y, Z.A_`
- Reference existing code to leverage using: `_Leverage: path/to/file.ts, path/to/component.tsx_`
- Focus only on coding tasks (no deployment, user testing, etc.)
- **Avoid broad terms**: No "system", "integration", "complete" in task titles

## Good vs Bad Task Examples
❌ **Bad Examples (Too Broad)**:
- "Implement authentication system" (affects many files, multiple purposes)
- "Add user management features" (vague scope, no file specification)
- "Build complete dashboard" (too large, multiple components)

✅ **Good Examples (Atomic)**:
- "Create User model in models/user.py with email/password fields"
- "Add password hashing utility in utils/auth.py using bcrypt"
- "Create LoginForm component in components/LoginForm.tsx with email/password inputs"
