# Requirements Document - AI/ML Orchestration Service

## Introduction

The AI/ML Orchestration Service specification defines the intelligent automation engine that powers the CRM platform's AI capabilities. This service orchestrates LangChain workflows, manages LLM interactions, provides AI-driven customer insights, and enables intelligent lead scoring and workflow automation. Built using Python with FastAPI, LangChain, and LangGraph, this service serves as the central nervous system for all AI-powered features in the platform.

The service implements production-ready AI orchestration patterns, handles complex multi-agent workflows, and provides the foundation for intelligent automation that helps SMB customers compete with enterprise-level AI capabilities.

4. WHEN lead score is calculated THEN the system SHALL provide explainable AI reasoning for the score components
5. WHEN lead scores are generated THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trail for compliance and model improvement

### Requirement 3: Multi-Agent Workflow Management

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want complex business processes automated through intelligent agents that can collaborate to handle customer inquiries, data analysis, and decision making, so that I can scale my operations without proportionally increasing staff.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex workflow is initiated THEN the system SHALL use LangGraph to orchestrate multiple specialized agents
2. WHEN agents need to collaborate THEN the system SHALL manage state sharing and communication between agents
3. IF agent execution fails THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation and human handoff capabilities
4. WHEN workflow requires external data THEN agents SHALL integrate with CRM, communication, and analytics services
5. WHEN workflow completes THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive execution summary with agent contributions

### Requirement 4: Conversational AI and Customer Insights

**User Story:** As a marketing professional, I want AI-powered customer insights that can analyze conversation history, behavior patterns, and interaction data to provide actionable recommendations, so that I can improve customer engagement and conversion rates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN customer interaction data is available THEN the AI SHALL generate insights about preferences, pain points, and next best actions
2. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with customer knowledge base
3. IF customer asks questions THEN the system SHALL provide contextually relevant responses using conversation history
4. WHEN insights are generated THEN the system SHALL rank recommendations by confidence level and potential impact
5. WHEN customer sentiment changes THEN the system SHALL detect and alert relevant team members within 5 minutes

### Requirement 5: AI Model Management and Optimization

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want centralized AI model management with performance monitoring, cost optimization, and quality control, so that I can ensure reliable AI services while controlling operational costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI models are deployed THEN the system SHALL support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) with failover
2. WHEN LLM calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching to reduce costs and improve response times
3. IF AI model performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to backup models and alert administrators
4. WHEN tokens are consumed THEN the system SHALL track usage by tenant, feature, and model for cost allocation
5. WHEN model responses are generated THEN the system SHALL implement quality checks and filter inappropriate content

### Requirement 6: Real-time AI Processing Pipeline

**User Story:** As a sales representative, I want real-time AI processing of customer interactions that can provide instant recommendations, sentiment analysis, and next steps during conversations, so that I can respond more effectively and close more deals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN customer interaction occurs THEN the system SHALL process it through AI pipeline within 2 seconds
2. WHEN processing real-time data THEN the system SHALL use streaming APIs for immediate response capability
3. IF processing queue builds up THEN the system SHALL prioritize high-value customers and time-sensitive interactions
4. WHEN real-time insights are generated THEN the system SHALL deliver them via WebSocket to active user sessions
5. WHEN system is under high load THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to cached responses rather than failing

### Requirement 7: Multi-tenant AI Isolation and Security

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want strict tenant isolation for AI processing that ensures customer data privacy, prevents cross-tenant contamination, and maintains compliance with data protection regulations, so that I can safely serve multiple SMB customers on the same infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria
