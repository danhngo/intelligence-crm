# Requirements Document - Workflow Engine Service

## Introduction

The Workflow Engine Service specification defines the visual workflow automation platform that empowers SMB users to create, manage, and execute complex business processes without code. This service provides a drag-and-drop workflow builder, template management, conditional logic, multi-channel integrations, and real-time execution monitoring. Built using Python with FastAPI and modern workflow orchestration libraries, this service democratizes business process automation for non-technical users while providing enterprise-grade reliability and performance.

The service implements intuitive visual workflow design, robust execution engines, and comprehensive integration capabilities that enable SMBs to automate repetitive tasks, improve operational efficiency, and scale their operations without requiring dedicated development resources.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This specification directly supports the product vision by:

- **SMB Empowerment**: Providing no-code workflow automation that enables small teams to implement enterprise-level process automation without technical expertise
- **AI-First Design**: Integrating with AI/ML Orchestration Service to embed intelligent decision-making and automation into business workflows
- **Learning Platform**: Delivering hands-on experience with modern workflow orchestration patterns, visual design tools, and business process management
- **Scalable Automation**: Creating workflow infrastructure that can handle simple task automation to complex multi-step business processes
- **Cost-Efficient Operations**: Reducing manual work and operational overhead through intelligent automation suitable for SMB budgets

1. WHEN a user browses templates THEN the system SHALL provide categorized templates for sales, marketing, customer service, and operations
2. WHEN a user selects a template THEN the system SHALL allow customization of parameters, triggers, and actions before deployment
3. IF a template requires external integrations THEN the system SHALL guide users through configuration and authentication setup
4. WHEN a user customizes a template THEN the system SHALL save the customized version as a new workflow while preserving the original template
5. WHEN templates are updated THEN the system SHALL notify users of improvements and offer optional upgrades to existing workflows

### Requirement 3: Conditional Logic and Decision Trees

**User Story:** As a sales manager, I want workflows that can make intelligent decisions based on customer data and behavior, so that I can create personalized automation that responds appropriately to different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds decision nodes THEN the system SHALL support multiple condition types including data comparisons, time-based rules, and external API responses
2. WHEN conditions are evaluated THEN the system SHALL route workflow execution through appropriate branches based on real-time data
3. IF multiple conditions exist THEN the system SHALL support AND/OR logic operators with proper precedence handling
4. WHEN decision outcomes are unclear THEN the system SHALL provide fallback paths and error handling routes
5. WHEN workflows execute THEN the system SHALL log decision points and outcomes for debugging and optimization analysis

### Requirement 4: Multi-Channel Integration Hub

**User Story:** As a marketing professional, I want workflows that can interact with multiple communication channels and business tools, so that I can create comprehensive automation that works across my entire technology stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures integrations THEN the system SHALL support email (SendGrid), SMS (Twilio), CRM (internal), and social media platforms
2. WHEN workflow actions execute THEN the system SHALL maintain authentication and handle API rate limits for external services
3. IF external service calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff and alert users to persistent failures
4. WHEN integration data flows THEN the system SHALL transform data formats between services and validate required fields
5. WHEN new integrations are added THEN the system SHALL provide standardized configuration interfaces and connection testing

### Requirement 5: Real-time Execution Monitoring

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want comprehensive visibility into workflow execution performance and outcomes, so that I can monitor automation effectiveness and troubleshoot issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows execute THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status updates with step-by-step progress tracking
2. WHEN execution errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information, affected data, and suggested remediation actions
3. IF workflows are running THEN the system SHALL display active executions with estimated completion times and current processing steps
4. WHEN execution completes THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports including success rates, processing times, and outcome metrics
5. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and provide diagnostic information for optimization

### Requirement 6: Workflow Scheduling and Triggers

**User Story:** As a sales representative, I want workflows that can be triggered by specific events, scheduled times, or external data changes, so that I can ensure timely and relevant automation responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures triggers THEN the system SHALL support time-based schedules, webhook events, data changes, and manual initiation
2. WHEN scheduled workflows execute THEN the system SHALL handle timezone management and provide scheduling conflict resolution
3. IF external events trigger workflows THEN the system SHALL validate event data and authenticate webhook sources
4. WHEN multiple triggers activate simultaneously THEN the system SHALL manage concurrent execution and prevent resource conflicts
5. WHEN trigger conditions change THEN the system SHALL update schedules dynamically and notify users of trigger modifications

### Requirement 7: Multi-tenant Workflow Isolation

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want strict isolation between customer workflows and data, so that each SMB client's automation processes remain completely private and secure while sharing infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows are created THEN the system SHALL enforce tenant boundaries preventing cross-customer data access or workflow visibility
2. WHEN workflow executions run THEN the system SHALL isolate processing resources and data to prevent tenant contamination
3. IF workflow data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt and segment data by tenant with automatic cleanup policies
