# Requirements Document - CRM Core Services

## Introduction

The CRM Core Services specification defines the foundational microservices that form the backbone of the intelligent CRM platform. This includes the User Management Service and CRM Management Service, which provide essential user authentication, authorization, contact management, and interaction tracking capabilities. These services are built using Go for high-performance, low-latency operations and serve as the foundation upon which AI-powered features will be built.

The core services implement enterprise-grade security, scalability patterns, and cost-efficient architectures suitable for SMB customers while providing the technical foundation for learning advanced cloud-native development patterns.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This specification directly supports the product vision by:

- **SMB-Centric Foundation**: Establishing cost-efficient, scalable core services that can grow with SMB needs
- **Enterprise Security**: Implementing role-based access control and security features required for business data
- **Learning Platform**: Providing hands-on experience with Go microservices, Kubernetes, and cloud-native patterns
- **AI-Ready Architecture**: Creating data models and APIs that support future AI-powered features like lead scoring and workflow automation
- **Performance Focus**: Delivering sub-2-second response times and 10K+ concurrent user support from the foundation level

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers with email/password THEN the system SHALL hash passwords using bcrypt and store securely in PostgreSQL
2. WHEN a user attempts login THEN the system SHALL validate credentials and return JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
3. IF user credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL return proper error response and log security events
4. WHEN JWT token expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication and refresh token flow
5. WHEN user updates profile information THEN the system SHALL validate changes and maintain audit trail

### Requirement 2: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**User Story:** As a team manager, I want to assign different permission levels to team members, so that sensitive customer data is only accessible to authorized personnel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin creates user account THEN the system SHALL allow assignment of roles: Admin, Manager, Sales, Marketing
2. WHEN user attempts protected action THEN the system SHALL validate role permissions before proceeding
3. IF user lacks required permissions THEN the system SHALL deny access and return 403 Forbidden response
4. WHEN role permissions change THEN the system SHALL update user access immediately without requiring logout
5. WHEN viewing user list THEN admins SHALL see role assignments and permission levels

### Requirement 3: Core Contact Management

**User Story:** As a marketing professional, I want comprehensive contact management with search and organization capabilities, so that I can efficiently track and nurture customer relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new contact THEN the system SHALL store name, email, phone, company, title, and custom fields in PostgreSQL
2. WHEN searching contacts THEN the system SHALL return results within 500ms using fuzzy matching on name, email, company
3. WHEN viewing contact details THEN the system SHALL display complete profile with interaction history and relationship data
4. IF contact data validation fails THEN the system SHALL return specific field errors and prevent incomplete saves
5. WHEN importing contact lists THEN the system SHALL process CSV files and handle duplicate detection/merging

### Requirement 4: Interaction Tracking and Timeline

**User Story:** As a sales representative, I want automatic tracking of customer interactions with timeline views, so that I can maintain context and provide personalized follow-ups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN customer interaction occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically log timestamp, type, channel, and context
2. WHEN viewing contact timeline THEN the system SHALL display chronological interaction history with filtering options
3. IF interaction data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL store partial data and flag for manual review
4. WHEN adding manual interaction notes THEN the system SHALL store rich text content with author attribution
5. WHEN generating interaction reports THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on frequency, outcomes, and next actions

### Requirement 5: Lead Management and Scoring Foundation

**User Story:** As a sales manager, I want lead status tracking and basic scoring capabilities, so that my team can prioritize high-value prospects effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new lead enters system THEN the system SHALL assign status: New, Qualified, Nurturing, Converted, or Lost
2. WHEN lead status changes THEN the system SHALL log transition with timestamp and reason
3. IF lead has been inactive for 30+ days THEN the system SHALL flag for follow-up and notify assigned representative
4. WHEN viewing lead pipeline THEN the system SHALL display leads by status with conversion metrics
5. WHEN lead converts THEN the system SHALL automatically create customer record and update reporting metrics

### Requirement 6: Multi-tenant Data Isolation

**User Story:** As a SaaS platform operator, I want strict data isolation between customer organizations, so that each SMB client's data remains completely private and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user authenticates THEN the system SHALL identify tenant organization and enforce data scope boundaries
2. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL automatically filter all results by tenant ID without manual specification
3. IF cross-tenant data access is attempted THEN the system SHALL block access and log security violation
4. WHEN creating new records THEN the system SHALL automatically assign current user's tenant ID
5. WHEN running background processes THEN the system SHALL process each tenant's data in complete isolation

### Requirement 7: API Gateway and Service Communication

**User Story:** As a platform developer, I want standardized API endpoints and inter-service communication, so that frontend applications and other services can reliably integrate with core CRM functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external client calls API THEN the system SHALL authenticate JWT tokens and enforce rate limiting
2. WHEN service-to-service communication occurs THEN the system SHALL use gRPC with protocol buffer definitions
3. IF API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 Too Many Requests with retry-after headers
4. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return consistent error format with correlation IDs for debugging
5. WHEN API documentation is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide up-to-date OpenAPI specifications with examples
