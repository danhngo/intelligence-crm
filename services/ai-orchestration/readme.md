AI Orchestration Service (Partially Implemented)
- Located in ai-orchestration
- Has basic database infrastructure setup with:
- Async SQLAlchemy configuration
- Connection pooling
- Tenant-scoped database sessions
- Error handling and logging
- Uses structured logging (structlog)
- Supports multi-tenancy through get_tenant_db() context manager
- Has environment configuration management (referenced by settings)

The database.py shows good practices:

- Connection pooling with tuned parameters
- Connection health checks (pool_pre_ping=True)
- Connection recycling (every 30 minutes)
- Proper error handling and rollback
- Tenant isolation at database level
- Async database operations using SQLAlchemy
- Let me check what other services are implemented:


AI Orchestration Service (More Complete Than Initially Thought)
- Has full LangChain integration:
+ Workflow management (app/langchain_workflows/)
+ Agent coordination (app/langchain_workflows/agents/)
+ Custom prompts (prompts.py)
+ Tools integration (tools.py)
+ Memory management (memory.py)
- Has data models for:
+ Insights (insights.py)
+ Workflows (workflow.py)
+ Agents (agent.py)
+ Scoring (scoring.py)
- Core infrastructure:
+ Database management
+ Caching (cache.py)
+ Configuration (config.py)


Not Yet Implemented:

- CRM Management Service
- Workflow Engine Service
- Communication Hub Service
- Analytics Service
- User Management Service


AI Orchestration Service (Most Complete)

Caching system
Implementation Priority Suggestion:

User Management Service (High Priority)

Required for authentication and authorization
Needed by all other services
CRM Management Service (High Priority)

Core business functionality
Required for meaningful AI orchestration
Communication Hub Service (Medium Priority)

Enables multi-channel interactions
Supports AI-driven communications
Workflow Engine Service (Medium Priority)

Can initially use basic workflow features from AI Orchestration
Expand later for more complex automation
Analytics Service (Lower Priority)

Can be implemented after core services are running
Initially use basic logging and metrics
